                <p class="nasdaq_objective-p text">Our project objective is to build something that will analyze live data and send us a daily list of stocks predicted to increase in value the following day. We want to identify stocks that can be expected to outperform the Nasdaq, and then create a way to send these alerts with the stock ticker symbols to alert for potential spikes in stock price.. Our project took two weeks to complete and we plan to continue to make improvements!</p>

                <p class="nasdaq_problem-p text">Have you ever sat down at 5 o’clock to watch “Mad Money” or other finance shows? As you listen to Jim Cramer speak very quickly, he lists off eight to ten companies that have been up “blank_%” and you think, “why haven’t I heard of these folks?” Well, if you’re anything like us, sometimes you miss one or two.</p>

                <p class="nasdaq_solution-p text">The idea is to help the average trader/investor who likes researching capital markets and active investing. But ultimately, we attempted to make something we would use ourselves.</p>
                <p class="nasdaq_solution-p text">The predictive random forest model was trained on all companies listed on the Nasdaq in the past year, with data beginning in April 2019 and ending in July 2020.</p>
                <p class="nasdaq_solution-p text">For a small fee, we were able to test over 900,000 data points; specifically looking at closing prices with regard to returns.</p>

                        <p class="nasdaq_process-p text">As with all models, model quality relies on your data. We were able to find historical data for all Nasdaq tickers as of July 2020, with the ability to backtest for 10 years. We focused on YTD information so that we were able to factor in pandemic volatility.</p>
                        <p class="nasdaq_process-p text">It took some time to work with the dataset but, after we had a clean Pandas DataFrame, we were able to view each ticker’s “close” price. We were then able to calculate daily returns, including a shift to account for bias.</p>
                        <p class="nasdaq_process-p text">We chose Random Forest Classifier to accomplish this task for two reasons:</p>
                        <ol class="nasdaq_process-ol">
                            <li>There were plenty of data points for the model to learn.</li>
                            <li>The data contained a couple of significant events such as:</li>
                        </ol>
                        <ul class="nasdaq_process-ul">
                            <li>Pre COVID</li>
                            <li>COVID Crash</li>
                            <li>COVID Recovery</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <p class="nasdaq_process-p text">After testing the model, we were able to predict returns with 100% accuracy, so naturally we believed something had to be wrong. We spent all of our time on AWS Sagemaker, a service provided by Amazon that allows you to prepare, build, train, and deploy machine learning models on the cloud.! AWS also offers access to their computing power. Here is an example above of what some of the code looks like.</p>
                    <div class="nasdaq_process-img-container d-block d-lg-none">
                        <img class="nasdaq_process-img img-fluid " src="assets/project3_image2.jpg">
                    </div>
                    <p class="nasdaq_process-p text">Once we had the model trained and running without error, the team got together and uploaded the files through AWS S3 and passed our data into an AWS Lambda function. To finish, the “Makefile” had to run through CloudWatch SNS in order to make the daily or weekly email alert possible. This step provided us with the opportunity to receive feedback and connect with subscribers. To get an idea of what this looks like, here is a chunk of the code in cells compared to what it looks like in a function:</p>
                    <div class="nasdaq_process-img-laptops-container">

                    </div>
                    <p class="nasdaq_process-p text"><strong>Deploying the Model</strong></p>
                    <p class="nasdaq_process-p text">For the model to be useful, it needed to be deployable. Again, we opted to use AWS to execute the model once a day. We ran into a potential issue with our file sizes, in particular the data and imported libraries. To solve this problem, we uploaded the data separately on S3, and then we used CloudWatch to configure the daily emails. After debugging, we were able to deploy and the email was requested.</p>

                        <li>Incorporate a regressor and train the data using different models like Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA).</li>
                        <li>Improve email messaging to enhance user experience.</li>
                        <li>Limit the number of tickers that our function returns to the top 15 companies.</li>
